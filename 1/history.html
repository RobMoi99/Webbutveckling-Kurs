                    Through extensive nagging from my father,
                    I decided to give coding a chance.
                    Not because he had any idea of what
                    a programming language even is,
                    but because his friend told him
                    that there is a lot of money in
                    that field. I gave it a try and
                    now I love it. I studied economics
                    in high school, so it took a sharp
                    turn from there.
